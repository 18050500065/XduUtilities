Login IDS with a universal method in .NET.

## Usage
1. Compile

2. Enter your student ID and password and set up correct time when we change timetable, click "Fetch" (a.k.a. “获取”) button

3. Find your iCalendar (.ics) file on your **PC'S DESKTOP, NOT REAL :)**

**Be sure that you enter correct ID and password. Invalid ID-password pattern will cause verification required. Up to now, I have not finish verification part (a lazy programmer). Besides, use your ID (11-digit number) instead of alias to avoid some unexpected errors.**

**Install iCal.NET and Newtonsoft.Json in NuGet before compiling.**
